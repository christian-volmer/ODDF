    Implements simulator block elaboration whereby existing simulator blocks
    step may create new blocks, for example to better support certain
    combinations of input and output types. A sum taking an integer and a double
    as inputs may convert itself to a block that sums doubles preceded by a
    type-conversion block for the integer input. Another example is where
    operations on busses are individualised.

	How do we deal with connectivity changes, e.g, blocks with dangling inputs/outputs.

	    - Maybe connection changes using one of the members of `SimulatorBlockInput` and `SimulatorBlockOutput` should be reported
